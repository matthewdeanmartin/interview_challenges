# Interview Challenges

All my leet code and interview challenges. This will become private after my job search is over.

Please see my Github homepage for complete projects in both python and dotnet, both handwritten and AI-assisted.

## LeetCode

These [leetcode solutions](leet) are from the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) website. They're not a full proof
because leetcode runs dozens or hundreds of unit tests which I didn't see a convenient way to copy to here.

For what it is worth, I have never taken a datastructures or algorithms class. To the extent that
leetcode is checking your memory of those two courses, I will not test well.

## Code Wars

Like leetcode but no intellisense or code completion.

## Platforms compared

As of 2024
- Codewars: Aimed at developers practicing. Free, no intellisense. Qualified.io is their interview product.
- Leetcode: Aimed at developers practicing for interviews. Large free section, some features behind paywall. Unclear if paid version is worth it.
- Codesignal: Aimed at companies who need to administer interviews. Some sort of expensive training plan.

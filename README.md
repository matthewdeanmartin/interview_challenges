## LeetCode

These [leetcode solutions](leet) are from the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) website. They're not a full proof
because leetcode runs dozens or hundreds of unit tests which I didn't see a convenient way to copy to here.

For what it is worth, I have never taken a datastructures or algorithms class. To the extent that
leetcode is checking your memory of those two courses, I will not test well.
